<h2> Good things to eat and where to find them </h2>

<h2>09/06/2017: Dosa </h2>
<p>
  Dosas are a favorite in India.   They are made from a chickpea and rice batter that is fried on a griddle.
  In India these are very cheap . . unfortunately, they will cost you in Toronto.

  <h2> 07/10/2017: Spicy Pot </h2>
    <p>  Ma la xiang guo is a dish from the Sichuan/Chongqing region of China.  You can
      select a number of different items that are cooked together.
      This dish uses a special numbing spice (ma) together with spicy chilli (la) cooked until
      fragrant (xiang) in a big pot (guo). </p>
